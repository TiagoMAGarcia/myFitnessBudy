Dark Chocolate Dipped Macaroons-63-1-LowCarb-2 large egg whites room temperature, 1/3 teaspoon (1 packet) stevia sweetener, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 1/2 cups (90g) unsweetened coconut flakes (Like Bob’s Red Mill), 3 ounces (85g) 72% dark chocolate chopped, 1 teaspoon coconut oil-Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Put the egg whites in a large mixing bowl and add the stevia and vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer until the egg whites are opaque and stiff peaks form when you lift the beater straight up. Gently fold the coconut into the egg whites with a rubber spatula. Use a cookie scoop or soup spoon to make balls about the size of a walnut and drop 1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Set the lined baking sheet aside for later. Put the chocolate in a small saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is 3/4 melted. Remove from heat, add the coconut oil, and continue to stir until all the chocolate has melted. Alternatively, melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl at 50% power in 30-second bursts, stirring between cooking times, until the chocolate is melted. Put the saucepan or bowl of chocolate on a clean countertop with a folded towel under half of the pan so the chocolate pools to one side and makes dipping easier. Gently pick up the macaroons by the top and dip the bottoms in the chocolate; place on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Chill until the chocolate has set, 20 minutes. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
